    <h3>Our Commitment to the Players</h3>
    <p>
      Higher divisions will carry higher prizes. All the participants must at least register at their most recent rank.
      Players may register in a higher rank to challenge themselves, but <strong>sandbagging and cheating activity will
        not be tolerated</strong>. The tournament director holds the right to ban players who register false
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The registration fee goes to the administration, referees, and AI analysis of suspicious games by the technical
      team. We strive to maintain a pleasant and fair tournament experience for all participants. Your commitment fee
      will help the administration, referee, and Anti-AI technical team to prepare for their work in advance, and
      discourage forfeiting.
    </p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      All participants are <strong>required to join the zoom call</strong>. To help reduce the possibility of AI or
      outside assistance, we highly recommend that all players complete the full camera setup below. If you are unable
      to complete the camera setup, in the rare case of reports, all decisions are non-disputable and left to the TD.
      Players are responsible for their own technical issues during the tournament. Please <strong>remain in the zoom
        call</strong> throughout the tournament and turn your camera off if you finished your game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camera must fully capture your face (only medical electronic devices are allowed), your hands (visible at all
      times), and the computer screen (only KGS and zoom open). Players <strong>cannot communicate with anyone</strong>
      during games unless in emergencies. If you notice any suspicious activity, please <strong>immediately report to
        the TD</strong> by private message or the raise hand feature.
    </p>
    <h3><i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheating</h3>
    <p>
      Let's be real, no one will believe a person who claims to be 8d online and 1d in person. Please don't cheat.
      Everyone knows who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you suspect your opponent uses AI, please complete the game as normal and report to the tournament director
      after the game. The tournament director may not intervene in ongoing games but may use the game records as
      evidence of the investigation. The tournament director could initiate an investigation with or without any reports
      received. If a player had been found highly suspicious, the tournament director reserves the right to dismiss the
      results and ban the player from the tournament. Most of the commitment fee is used in the administration and
      Anti-AI investigation systems. We have one of the strongest AI analysis tools to monitor your games. If the
      similarity of the entire game matches 50% or more, it is considered highly suspicious of AI usage. The TD team may
      then make the final decision based on the results of the analysis and historical game records of the player.
    </p>
    <p>
      If video recording cannot be provided upon request, any decision made by the TD team will be final. <strong>The referee team highly
      recommends that players in all divisions save a video recording of all rounds</strong>, especially players in the open division.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be using the strongest AI analysis tool, <a href="https://19x19.com/" target="_blank">Golaxy</a> to
      monitor the tournament. Top US and Canadian players, with an AI expert from Golaxy, will serve as the Arbitration
      Committee to make the final decision if the similarity of the entire game matches 50% or more. A similarity
      matching 70% or more is equivalent to professional play. The similarity matching 60% is equivalent to at least AGA
      7d.
