      <h3>Our Commitment to the Players</h3>
      <p>
      Higher divisions will carry higher prizes. All the participants must at least register at their most recent rank. Players may register in a higher rank to challenge themselves, but <strong>sandbagging and cheating activity will not be tolerated</strong>. The tournament director holds the right to ban players who register false information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The registration fee goes to the administration, referees, and AI analysis of suspicious games by the technical team. We strive to maintain a pleasant and fair tournament experience for all participants. Your commitment fee will help the administration, referee, and Anti-AI technical team to prepare for their work in advance, and discourage forfeiting.
      </p>
