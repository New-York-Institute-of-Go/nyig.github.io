        <p>
            Youth classes at NYIG are taught by world-class Go instructors. The curriculum at NYIG uses <em>The Divine Move of Go</em> textbook series, a systematic English instructional curriculum developed by our teachers, which offers a structured learning plan from beginner to master. A typical class begins with a lecture of new materials, in-class exercises and walkthrough, followed by practice games and a brief review.
        </p>
        <p>
            We adopt a hybrid class format, allowing students to take the same course online and on-site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Class length varies from one hour to three hours depending on the difficulty. The number of students in each class is limited to 10, including both online and on-site. This limit ensures that each student receives targeted learning and required guidance from the instructor.
        </p>
